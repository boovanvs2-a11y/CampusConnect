Here is a breakdown of the CampusConnect layout and features, designed to look professional, modern, and "hackathon-winning."

📐 The Layout Strategy: "Bento Grid" Architecture
We used a 3-Column Bento Grid layout. This is a popular design trend (used by Apple and Linear) where content is organized into distinct, modular "boxes" or cards. This keeps the interface clean despite having a lot of information.

Left Column (25%): The "Academic Anchor" – Fixed, stable resources (Notes, Contacts).
Center Column (50%): The "Campus Pulse" – Dynamic, changing content (Clubs, Events, Live Map).
Right Column (25%): The "Innovation Hub" – Exploration and contributions (Projects).
1. Left Sidebar: The Study Portal 📚
Purpose: Quick access to daily academic needs without cluttering the main view.
Design: Vertical Card with a "Glassmorphism" background (blur effect).
Key Feature - "Accordions":
My Notes: Collapsible list of subjects. Clicking expands to show recent uploads.
Faculty Contacts: Collapsible list of professors with Live Status Indicators (Green = Available, Yellow = In Class).
Schedule: Shows your next class immediately.
2. Center Stage: The 3 Key Pillars 🎯
This is where the user spends most of their time. It is divided into three stacked sections:

A. Campus Clubs (Top)

Layout: Horizontal Scroll (Carousel).
Feature: "Authorized Creation". The Create Club button has a lock icon, implying only authorized personnel (like Head Students/Faculty) can start a new club, preventing spam.
Interaction: Students can scroll through cards and click "Join".
B. Upcoming Events (Middle)

Layout: List View.
Design: Minimalist cards showing Date (bold box), Title, and Location.
Purpose: Replaces the "WhatsApp Group Spam" by having a clean, single source of truth for events.
C. Navigation Map (Bottom)

Style: "Uber-Style" Dark Mode Map.
Visuals: We generated a custom 3D isometric map asset that looks high-tech and navigational.
Functionality:
"Where to?" Search Bar: Floating search bar (like Google Maps) to quickly find the Canteen, Library, or specific blocks.
Live Context: A bottom floating panel showing your "Current Location" and "Nearby Live Events."
3. Right Sidebar: Explore & Upload 🚀
Purpose: To showcase student innovation and encourage participation.
Layout: Vertical Feed (TikTok/Instagram Reels style aspect ratio for thumbnails).
Content: A feed of "Trending Projects" created by other students (e.g., "AI Campus Bot").
Sticky Action: The Upload Project button is pinned to the bottom, making it always accessible for students to contribute their own work for credits.
🎨 Visual Language
Mode: Light/Dark mode hybrid (soft grays and whites).
Colors:
Primary Purple/Indigo: Represents Wisdom & Technology.
Rose/Pink Accents: Used for Social/Events (Connect).
Amber/Orange: Used for Discussion/Ideas.
**Micro
-Interactions**: Every card has a subtle "Hover Lift" effect, making the app feel tactile and responsive.
